Languages

Idlak has been designed to work with and provide examples in multiple languages.
Generally languages are refered to by their languages codes in programs.

* Language (lng) codes are `2 letter ISO_639-1 codes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`_
* Accent (acc) codes are 2 ASCII letters, see :ref:`accents`

A note on archectures: In Idlak we allow for multiple versions of resources to
sit along side one another. These are called archectures and are
in the language resource xml names after the final "-".
Idlak requires that the default archecture be defined so the file
names below all have a ``-default.xml`` ending. In general Idlak
can choose alternative archectures for individual resources.

***********************
Creating a new language
***********************

The sections below explain the required resources for languages.
Some of the resources are accent specific, these have been marked.
In general all language resources can be overridden by specific accents.

Phoneset
========

.. code-block:: none

    idlak-data/<lng>/<acc>/phoneset-default.xml

*Accent specific*

In IPA there would be multiple ways to write "r" in English, that are from a comprehension
point of view the same, but a statistical model would need to learn all of them
seperately. Alternatively nasalisation does not affect English phonemes, but they do for French.
For this reason in Idlak we use limited phonesets for each accent.
This prevents the explosion of data requirements.

Within Idlak phonemes are lower case ASCII letters, normally limited
to three characters. Numbers are used for stress and tone, so cannot be part
of a phoneme name. As much as possible different accents should use the same
symbols for equivalent phonemes.

The format for the phoneset is as follows:

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0"? encoding="utf-8">
  <phoneset language="" accent="" >
      <phone name="" ipa="" example-word="" example-pron="" syllabic="" />
      ...
  </phoneset>


Where

* **name** - The ASCII name of the phoneme
* **ipa** - The cannonical IPA representation, it should be noted that multiple IPA symbols
            can be mapped onto this phoneme, but this is what should be considered the representative
            pronounciation.
* **example-word** - The cannonical example word for the phoneme
* **example-pron** - The full pronounciation for the example
* **syllabic** - True if the phoneme is syllabic

Lexicon
=======

.. code-block:: none

    idlak-data/<lng>/<acc>/lexicon-default.xml

*Accent specific*

The lexicon or pronounciation dictionary lists words that have known pronounciations
using the accent specific phoneset. It is possible to have multiple pronounciations for the
same word (grapheme). The lexicon format for a single entry is as follows:

.. code-block:: xml

    <lex pron="" entry="" default="">grapheme</lex>

for example

.. code-block:: xml

    <lex pron="ih0 g z ae1 m p ah0 l" entry="full" default="true">example</lex>


Where

* **pron** - The correct pronounciation, including stress, using the Idlak phoneset.
* **entry** - A name for different pronounciations. Commonly these can be something like
              ``full``,  ``reduced``, ``noun``, or ``verb``. Alternatively these can
              be numbers to indicate multiple correct pronounciations. The allows for
              homograph resolution and  for the user to change which entry is spoken in
              the input.
* **default** - Which entry should be pronounced given no other information,
                one and only one entry must be true.

The overall format for the lexicon is:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <lexicon>
        <lex pron="a0" entry="full" default="true">Ð°</lex>
        ..
    </lexicon>

The lexicon has an optional ``name`` attribute.


LTS rules
=========

.. code-block:: none

    idlak-data/<lng>/<acc>/ccart-default.xml

*Accent specific*

Currently the Idlak front-end uses cart trees for letter-to-sound rules.

We have a script that can automatically generate this file from the lexicon, using
`Phonetisaurus <https://github.com/AdolfVonKleist/Phonetisaurus>`_.
(Fill in the path, language code, and accent code)

.. code-block:: none

    IDIR=<path to idlak>
    cd $IDIR/idlak-misc/cart_lts
    ./run.sh -i $IDIR/idlak-data/<lng>/<acc>/lexicon-default.xml -o $IDIR/idlak-data/<lng>/<acc>/ccart-default.xml



Tokeniser rules
===============

.. code-block:: none

    idlak-data/<lng>/trules-default.xml

The tokeniser rules govern how text is split into individual tokens. These
are a series of regular expression (PCRE) that govern what is considered to be
letters, numbers, etc. All of the rules are manditory. A rule is of the form:

.. code-block:: xml

    <regex name="matches a name in the tokeniser">
        <comment>
            Description as to the purpose of the rule and any interesting
            things about this language's version.
        </comment>
        <exp>
            <![CDATA[regex]>
        </exp>
    </regex>


The list of rules understood and required by the tokeniser is as follows:

* **whitespace** what is considered to be whitespace in the language
* **seperators** characters that should always be put on their own token
* **alpha** the lower and uppercase letters of that lanugage, note that you do not need to include diacritics
* **downcase** the mapping from uppercase to lowercase letters
* **decompose** lookup for utf8 decomposition into NFD form see
    `Unicode_equivalence <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence>`_.
    This can be generated automatically from the lexicon.
* **convertillegal** a lookup for changing characters from one form to another
    espically useful for converting utf8 characters to ascii versions, and for
    stripping diacritics that are not part of the language.
* **utfpunc2ascii** a lookup for converting alternative utf-8 versions of punctuation to ascii versions
* **asdigits** The names in the language of numerals.
* **symbols** The names in the language of symbols.

In general you can copy the English one and make a few modifications.


Normalizer rules
================

**Whole langauge**:

.. code-block:: none

    idlak-data/<lng>/nrules-default/*.xml

**Accent specific**:

.. code-block:: none

    idlak-data/<lng>/<acc>/nrules-default/*.xml

**NB** Unlike other resources the accent specific rules are *appended* to the lanugage rules.
