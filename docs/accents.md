Idlak includes accents for specific languages to account for regional variations
of the language. These accents are represented by 2 ascii letter codes that can
be repeated across multiple languages, but are unique for each language.
By convention we use the 2 letter abbreviation from the country of origin unless
there is a reason not to.
