Versioning scheme</h1>
<p>During its lifetime, Kaldi has has three different versioning methods. Originally Kaldi was a subversion (svn)-based project, and was hosted on Sourceforge. Then Kaldi was moved to github, and for some time the only version-number available was the git hash of the commit.</p>
<p>In January 2017 we introduced a version number scheme. The first version of Kaldi was 5.0.0, in recognition of the fact that the project had already existed for quite a long time. The basic scheme is major/minor/patch, but the "patch" version number may also encompass features (usually back-compatible ones). The "patch number" automatically increases whenever a commit to Kaldi is merged on github.</p>
<p>We only intend to change the major or minor version number when making relatively larger changes, or non-back compatible changes.</p>
<p>We always plan to recommend that Kaldi users check out the latest version of 'master', since actively supporting multiple versions would increase our workload.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="versions_versions"></a>
Versions (and changes)</h1>
<p>This section lists the version numbers of Kaldi with the commit messages for each patch commit (by "patch commit" we mean a commit that does not increase the major or minor version number). Each time we add a new major/minor version number we will include a longer section explaining the changes involved.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="versions_versions_50"></a>
Version 5.0</h2>
<p>This is the first major/minor version number after introducing the versioning scheme. The latest revision of version 5.0 is saved as branch "5.0" on github.</p>
<p>Below are commits corresponding to minor version numbers 5.0.x.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="versions_versions_51"></a>
Version 5.1</h2>
<p>Some of the major changes introduced in version 5.1 are:</p><ul>
<li>Kaldi now requires C++11 to compile, and we support only the latest version of OpenFst (1.6.0). (This simplifies Kaldi's code, and will later enable the threading code to be <a href="https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/pull/1350" target="_blank">rewritten</a> to use C++11's better and more portable mechanisms).</li>
<li>The way chunk size and feature context is handled in nnet3 is changed to allow variable chunk size and shorter context at utterance boundaries. See <a class="el" href="dnn3_scripts_context.html">Context and chunk-size in the "nnet3" setup</a> for more information.</li>
<li>A new decoding mechanism, <a class="el" href="dnn3_scripts_context.html#dnn3_scripts_context_looped">Looped decoding</a>, is introduced in nnet3; this allows faster and more-easily-online decoding for recurrent setups (but only unidirectionally-recurrent ones, like LSTMs but not BLSTMs).</li>
<li><a class="el" href="online_decoding.html#online_decoding_nnet3">Online decoding with nnet3 models</a> is now rewritten; it's faster and it supports models like LSTMs.</li>
<li>The sequence-training scripts in nnet3 are refactored and are now simpler and use less disk space.</li>
<li>There are scripts for segmentation of long transcribed audio files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latest revision of version 5.1 is saved as branch "5.1" on github.</p>
<p>Below are commits corresponding to minor version numbers 5.1.x.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="versions_versions_52"></a>
Version 5.2</h2>
<p>Some of the changes introduced between 5.1 and 5.2 are:</p><ul>
<li>Upgrades to nnet3 to support batch-norm and convolutional components; recipes for certain image tasks (like CIFAR).</li>
<li>nnet3 training script simplifications and refactoring.</li>
<li>Some of the recipes are upgraded to include dropout and the &ndash;proportional-shrink option (which approximates l2 regularization); this improves results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many changes were made in the commits listed below (i.e. in the minor versions 5.2.x), including:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/pull/1676">Speech/nonspeech segmentation based on nnet3 </a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/pull/1633">Scripts for transfer learning/domain-adaptation of nnet3 models </a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/pull/1896">Xvectors: DNN Embeddings for Speaker Recognition </a></li>
</ul>
<p>The latest revision of version 5.2 is saved as branch "5.2" on github.</p>
<p>Below are commits corresponding to minor version numbers 5.1.x.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="versions_versions_53"></a>
Version 5.3</h2>
<p>Major changes that were made between the end of 5.2.x and the start of the 5.3 branch include:</p><ul>
<li>Create a nnet3-based setup for RNN language models (i.e. recurrent and neural net based language models)</li>
<li>Some extentions to the core of the nnet3 framework to support constant values and scalar multiplication without dedicated compoennts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are commits corresponding to minor version numbers 5.3.x.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="versions_versions_54"></a>
Version 5.4</h2>
<p>The main changes that were made between the end of 5.3.x and the start of the 5.4 branch include:</p><ul>
<li>Some code changes in the nnet3 codebase, for speed and memory efficiency.</li>
<li>Various simplifications and code reorganizations in the nnet3 code.</li>
<li>Support for a new kind of factorized TDNN (TDNN-F) which gives substantially better results than our old TDNN recipe, and is even better than our old TDNN+LSTM recipe. A good example of this is in egs/swbd/s5c/local/chain/tuning/run_tdnn_lstm_1n.sh. Some nnet3 code changes were needed for this as well (mostly: support for constraining a matrix to have orthonormal rows).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the larger changes that were made while 5.4 was the major version number include:</p><ul>
<li>Improvements to handwriting recognition and OCR recipes, including BPE (word-piece) encoding.</li>
<li>An updated version of the TDNN-F configuration, including ResNet-style bypass, which is now the default in many recipes. (it's called tdnnf-layer in xconfigs).</li>
<li>A rewrite of the CUDA memory allocator to be based on a small number of large regions (since with newer drivers and hardware, allocation speed was becoming a bottleneck).</li>
<li>A decoder speedup (make use of OpenFst's NumInputEpsilons() function).</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are commits corresponding to minor version numbers 5.4.x.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="versions_versions_55"></a>
Version 5.5</h2>
<p>Version 5.5 is the current master branch. The change that was made between the end of 5.4 and the start of 5.5 is support for <a class="el" href="grammar.html">Support for grammars and graphs with on-the-fly parts.</a> grammar decoding; this allows support for things like the "contact list scenario" where you want to use a dynamically changing contact list in a larger, fixed decoding graph.</p>
<p>Below are commits corresponding to minor version numbers 5.5.x.</p>
